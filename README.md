Basic notes on operating system
Memory -- > Ram , Harddisk , Registers , Cache 
CPU will pull the program line by line from the memory and will execute it .
any program which CPU want to run should be in ram . Apart from program , there will be data inside ram which the cpu will use .
The data will copied  from harddisk to RAM and then CPU will access it because the access time of ram is kinda million times that of harddisk .

Need of Operating System:
Long term scheduler is a program in operating system which will decide which programs needs to kept inside ram .
Operating system is called as resource manager (any device we use can be called as a resource s ram is a resource and os is allocating programs to ram )
If there are two process in ram and they are competing to access RAM , In that case function in os will decide whcih process will access first . This functionality of OS is called as short term Scheduler.
